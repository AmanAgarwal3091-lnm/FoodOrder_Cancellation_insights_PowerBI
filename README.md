# FoodOrder_Cancellation_insights_PowerBI
Managing the tricky equilibrium between client happiness and operational efficiency 
is essential in food ordering platforms. In order to find useful information, areas for 
improvement, and potential for lowering order cancellations while maintaining 
customer satisfaction, this case study analyses cancellation data from a food ordering 
platform. The food platform on average encounter 100 cancellations out of the 10,000 
orders processed daily, this means a cancellation rate of 1% which is moderate.

By analysing the problem statement and the data points in the given tables, we can get 
the following points:

Modes of Cancellation:
Either by Restaurant or through App

Reasons of cancellation: 5 reasons of cancellation 
1) Customer Refusal
2) Stock Shortage
3) Item Unavailable
4) Closed Premises
5) High Demand at the Restaurant

Cancellation Policy: Distinguishes between packaged items, buffet items, and 
non-MRP items. Packaged and buffet items can be cancelled by users. 
Whereas, non-MRP items can be cancelled till order not accepted.

Goal of this case study is to prepare a strategy to minimise order cancellation and 
increase user satisfaction. Minimising cancellation will ensure that we have user 
retention and that they will recommend us to potential customers as well. Through 
this we can make up for the losses caused due to cancellation of orders and may also 
get new users, which will help in revenue increase.
